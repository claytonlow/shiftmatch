# Demo

This demo project was setup for the purposes of ShiftMatch. 

Keeping in mind, this uses mock data generated using the faker library once the app is loaded. 

This mock data is not persisted during page reloads, it's ephemeral so the mock data will change everytime.

This app also utilizes NgRx for state management across the project. Once again this does not persist on pages loads for this demo

## Third party libs
Moment (Date handling)
ng-matero (For the slide out drawer)
Tabler icons
Material Ui

## Setup

Run `npm install` to install dependencies

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

I haven't got to the unit tests, due to time constraints, however something i can add later if you wish.

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
